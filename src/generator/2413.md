# Sum of a Prime

## Problem

Given an array of integers, return the sum of all bits set to 1

Examples:

- [7] should return 3
- [1,2,3] should return 4
- [0,1,2,3,4,5] should return 7
- [23,10,17] should return 8

## Instructions

Design a program/script that can solve this problem in a fast/interesting/elegant way.

Your program will need to run in a loop, listing to stdin.
An array will be given in the form "5,7,2,7,2,3,5\n" and you will output "14\n".

NB: inputs and outputs must all be terminated with a newline!
If your program receives a "q\n" as an input, it must exit gracefully and quietly.
