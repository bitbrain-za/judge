# Find Odd One Out Two

## Problem

Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times.

There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.

Examples:

- [7] should return 7, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
- [0] should return 0, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
- [1,1,2] should return 2, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
- [0,1,0,1,0] should return 0, because it occurs 3 times (which is odd).
- [1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,1] should return 4, because it appears 1 time (which is odd).

## Instructions

If the arguments are empty, print a "0" and return.

Design a program/script that can solve this problem in a fast/interesting/elegant way.

Your program will need to run in a loop, listing to stdin.
An array will be given in the form "5,7,2,7,2,3,5\n" and you will output "3\n".

NB: inputs and outputs must all be terminated with a newline!
If your program receives a "q\n" as an input, it must exit gracefully and quietly.

## Making an attempt

For a real run, you will be tested against 1 000 000 random samples.

```bash
judge -C 2332 -c "python my_code.py" -L python
judge -C 2332 -c "./my_binary" -L go
```
