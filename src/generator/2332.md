# Find Odds

## Problem

Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times.

There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.

Examples:

- [7] should return 7, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
- [0] should return 0, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
- [1,1,2] should return 2, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
- [0,1,0,1,0] should return 0, because it occurs 3 times (which is odd).
- [1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,1] should return 4, because it appears 1 time (which is odd).

## Instructions

Design a program/script that can solve this problem in a fast/interesting/elegant way.
Your program should be able to accept a single command line of a comman separated string of u8

Return your results as a single number.
For example If you ran `./my_program "1,1,2"` the result should be `"1"`

## Making an attempt

For a real run, you will be tested against 1 000 000 random samples.

```bash
judge -C 2332 -c "python my_code.py" -L python
judge -C 2332 -c "./my_binary" -L go
```
