# Caesar's Cipher Encryption

## Problem

Given a clear text string and an integer shift, return the ciphertext.
The space is limited to [a-zA-Z].

You must retain case

Examples:

- "Super secret message", 10 should return "Cezob combod wocckqo"
- "Can you read this", 1 should return "Dbo zpv sfbe uijt"
- "NO", 5 should return "ST"
- "Edge case", 40 should return "Srus qogs"

## Instructions

Design a program/script that can return ciphertext using the Caesar Algorithm.

Your program will need to run in a loop, listing to stdin.
An input will be given in two lines.

```
cleartext
shift integer
```

and your output should be just the ciphertext followed by a newline.

All test cases will be longer than one character. 
If your program receives a "q\n" as an input, it must exit gracefully and quietly.
