# Sum of a Prime

## Problem

Given a number, return the count of prime factors

Examples:

- 41 is a prime so should return 1
- 18 has prime factors 2 and 3 so should return 2
- 2310 has prime factors 2, 3, 5, 7 and 11 should return 5

## Instructions

Design a program/script that can solve this problem in a fast/interesting/elegant way.

Your program will need to run in a loop, listing to stdin.
An integer will be given in the form "2310\n" and you will output "5\n".

The input will be a number up to 128 bits in length

NB: inputs and outputs must all be terminated with a newline!
If your program receives a "q\n" as an input, it must exit gracefully and quietly.

## Making an attempt

For a real run, you will be tested against 10 000 random samples.

```bash
judge -C 2411 -c "python my_code.py" -L python
judge -C 2411 "./my_binary" -L go
```
