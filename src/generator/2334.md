# Find the bad character

## Problem

Given a string, find the non alphanumeric character. Anything outside of the A-Z, a-z and 0-9 range
Return the bad character. If more than one bad character are in the string, just return the first one.

Examples:

- "Hello,world" should return ,
- "This|isbad" should return |
- "123456=89" should return =

## Instructions

Design a program/script that can solve this problem in a fast/interesting/elegant way.

Your program will need to run in a loop, listing to stdin.
A string will be given in the form "sting_to_be_inspected\n" and you will output "_\n".

NB: inputs and outputs must all be terminated with a newline!
If your program receives a "\n" as an input, it must exit gracefully and quietly.

## Making an attempt

For a real run, you will be tested against X random samples.

```bash
judge -C 2333 -c "python my_code.py" -L python
judge -C 2333 "./my_binary" -L go
```
